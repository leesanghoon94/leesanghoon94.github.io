POSIX
POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is a family of standards specified by the IEEE for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. POSIX defines a standard operating system interface and environment to support application portability at the source code level. It includes:

Shell and Utilities: Command-line interfaces and utilities (e.g., sh, awk, grep).
System APIs: System calls and libraries for handling tasks like file operations, process control, and inter-process communication.
Threading and Concurrency: Standards for multi-threading and concurrency (e.g., pthreads).
POSIX compliance ensures that software developed for one compliant operating system can be ported to another with minimal changes.

Signals in POSIX
Signals are a form of inter-process communication in POSIX-compliant systems. They are used to notify a process that a particular event has occurred. Each signal has a unique number and associated symbolic name (e.g., SIGTERM, SIGKILL, SIGUSR1).

Common Signals
SIGTERM (15): Termination signal. The default signal sent by the kill command. It allows the process to perform cleanup before exiting.
SIGKILL (9): Kill signal. Forces a process to terminate immediately without cleanup.
SIGINT (2): Interrupt signal. Typically sent when the user presses Ctrl+C.
SIGHUP (1): Hangup signal. Originally sent when a terminal session was disconnected.
SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2: User-defined signals for application-specific purposes.
SIGUSR1
SIGUSR1 is one of the user-defined signals (the other being SIGUSR2). These signals are not used by the system and are available for user applications to use for their own purposes.

Characteristics of SIGUSR1
Number: The numeric value of SIGUSR1 can vary between systems, but it's typically 10 or 30 depending on the system architecture.
Purpose: Defined by the application. Commonly used to trigger custom behavior or events within a process.
Handling: Can be caught, ignored, or handled by the process. If not explicitly handled, the default action is to terminate the process.
Usage Example
Here’s how you might handle SIGUSR1 in a C program:

c
코드 복사
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void handle_sigusr1(int sig) {
printf("Received SIGUSR1\n");
}

int main() {
// Set up the signal handler for SIGUSR1
signal(SIGUSR1, handle_sigusr1);

    // Loop indefinitely
    while (1) {
        printf("Waiting for SIGUSR1...\n");
        sleep(10);
    }

    return 0;

}
In this example, when SIGUSR1 is received, the handle_sigusr1 function is called, printing a message to the console.

Sending SIGUSR1
You can send SIGUSR1 to a process using the kill command. For example, if the process ID (PID) is 1234, you can send SIGUSR1 like this:

bash
코드 복사
kill -SIGUSR1 1234
Or using the signal number directly:

bash
코드 복사
kill -10 1234
Summary
POSIX: A set of standards to ensure compatibility between different operating systems.
Signals: A mechanism for inter-process communication in POSIX systems.
SIGUSR1: A user-defined signal that can be used by applications for custom purposes.
Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing robust and portable software in Unix-like operating systems.
